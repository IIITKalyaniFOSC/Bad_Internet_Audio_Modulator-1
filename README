Script to make input audio sound like its buffering due to bad internet connection.

Recquirements - 
-An audio system running on Pulseaudio (Any linux distro)
-sox (sudo apt install sox)

How to use - 
1. Load nullsink module with - 
	pactl load-module module-null-sink

2. Make buffer.sh executable

3. Run ./buffer.sh

Optional - Use the command - `pavucontrol` to route audio manually.

In the recording tab, sox should be taking input from the intended input device.
If all the previous steps have been completed.

4. ./buffer.sh will run the script for 20 minutes approx and you can increase the time by passing a number like
	./buffer.sh n
	
	n refers to n*250 seconds of time the program will run. Therefore by default 
	./buffer.sh 	and
	./buffer.sh 5   are the same

5. Then in the application where you want to modulate your voice, change the voice input to "Monitor of Null Output", which should be visible now.
